# Dark Premium Landing Page Style

A reusable AI skill/prompt reference for building premium, dark-themed, Apple-inspired landing pages.

Inspired by the visual style of [getcalendarly.com](https://getcalendarly.com/) — not a copy, but a distilled design system capturing the same aesthetic: pure black backgrounds, cinematic whitespace, scroll-triggered animations, and refined minimalism.

## What's inside

**[`skill.md`](./skill.md)** — The complete design system covering:

- Color palette (pure black, white opacity hierarchy, accent colors)
- Typography (Geist/Inter, type scale, spacing rules)
- Spacing system (8px grid, generous section padding)
- 7 component specs (nav, hero, CTAs, centered features, two-column features, floating icons, footer)
- Animation patterns (scroll fade-ins, marquee, hover effects)
- Gradient & overlay recipes (vignettes, glows)
- Responsive breakpoints
- Page structure & implementation checklist
- Copy tone guidelines
- Do's and don'ts

## Usage

Point any AI coding assistant at `skill.md` — use it as a system prompt, context file, or reference document when asking the AI to build a landing page in this style.
