# Dark Premium Landing Page Style

When building a landing page in this style, read and follow the full design system in AGENTS.md at the repository root.

It covers: color palette, typography, spacing, 7 component specs (nav, hero, CTAs, centered features, two-column features, floating icons, footer), animation patterns, gradient recipes, responsive breakpoints, page structure, copy tone, and do's/don'ts.

Key rules: pure #000 backgrounds, white text with opacity hierarchy, accent colors only for labels/checkmarks/glows, pill-shaped white CTAs, scroll-triggered fade-in animations with ease curves, generous 120px section padding, stroke-only icons.
